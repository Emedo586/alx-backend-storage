# NoSQL

## NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") is an approach to database design that focuses on providing a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

## MongoDB is a document-oriented database classified as NoSQL. It’s become popular throughout the industry in recent years and integrates extremely well with Python. Unlike traditional SQL RDBMSs, MongoDB uses collections of documents instead of tables of rows to organize and store data.

## Reviewing MongoDB’s Features
So Far As for the database management side, MongoDB offers the following features:
- Query support: You can use many standard query types, such as matching (==), comparison (<, >), and regular expressions.
- Data accommodation: You can store virtually any kind of data, be it structured, partially structured, or even polymorphic.
- Scalability: It handles more queries just by adding more machines to the server cluster.
- Flexibility and agility: You can develop applications with it quickly.
- Document orientation and schemalessness: You can store all the information regarding a data model in a single document.
- Adjustable schema: You can change the schema of the database on the fly, which reduces the time needed to provide new features or fix existing problems.
- Relational database functionalities: You can perform actions common to relational databases, like indexing.
